## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My main research interest is the use of artificial intelligence technology to address complex problems in engineering, such as equipment prognosis and health management, energy prediction, and defect detection. Specifically, I am developing signal processing, machine learning, or deep learning methods for fault diagnosis and remaining useful life prediction of centrifugal fans, turbine rotors, wind turbine gearboxes, bearings, and other equipment in thermal power plants; Constructing intelligent methods for predicting wind speed and wind power; Using computer vision technology for defect detection of wind turbine blades and solar panels.

My primary research focused on equipment fault diagnosis and condition monitoring based on signal processing techniques and deep learning algorithms. I have published 7 SCI papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=goCftmoAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRuijun19%2FRuijun19.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>  , several of which were published in top international journals such as IEEE TII and Measurement.
